``harmful.js``
==============

This is a userscript that helps disable harmful web development behaviors.
Right now, this script:

1. Disables programmatic selection of text (under most cases, I haven't figured
   out some corner cases).
2. Disables programmatic access to the clipboard.

In the future, this script intends to do more, such as replacing common
non-native controls with the standard HTML ones.

It has been tested with the Guerilla Scripting extension for Pale Moon.
